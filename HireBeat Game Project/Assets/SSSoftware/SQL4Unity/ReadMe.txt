			2 April:
				Error Opening a partitioned Table.
				Error Updating Indexed Column
			4 April
				Incorrect partitioning of Index for Partitioned table
			7 April
				Error on String Index when using alphabets from a mixture of cultures.
					NOTE: SQL4Unity uses the C# InvariantCulture and Ordinal for string compares, This will be reflected in ORDER BY and GROUP BY results.

				Improved Error Logging
					In the event of an unexpected error a .log file is now written to Application.persistentDataPath with one of the following names
						SQL4Unity
						SQLWorkbench
						SQLEngine
						SQLParse
					To reflect where the error occured.
					Please refer to the Unity documentation for the exact location of Application.persistentDataPath in your installation.
					If an SQL4Unity error occurs the variable SQL4Unity.Utility.HasError will be set to TRUE;
					To prevent any further processing after an error has occured the variable SQL4Unity.Utility.StopOnError can be set to TRUE during setup.

					Should you wish to add your own error logging the following may be used
						SQL4Unity.ErrMsg.Log(string message);
						SQL4Unity.ErrMsg.Log(string[] messages);
						This will also output the message to the Unity Console

						The error messages can then be written to the .log file by calling
						SQL4Unity.Utility.WriteErrorLog(string path);
							Note: path may include a full path and file name or just a file name. It should not contain a file extension as .log will be appended.
							If no path is included the output will be written to Application.persistentDataPath
							If no file name is used the default (SQL4Unity) will be used

				Error on Parameter substitution on recuuring use of Stored SQL
					Multiple executes of a stored SQL will reslt in corruption of parameter data. The database must be recreated to reset the stored SQL to its correct settings.

    V.1.0.3 February 2021

		This version contains many new features but is completely backwards compatible with version 1.0.2 so no update script is required.
		Some of the features may only take effect on newly defined/created databases.

		Note: This release is for Unity 2018.4 and newer. Unity versions lower than 2018.4 are no longer supported.
		The Dll's are now compiled using .Net Framework 4.7.1 and so your Unity projects must use the .Net 4.x as Scripting Runtime and Api Compatibility Level

		Please refer to the full documentation at https://stevesmith.software for more detailed information on the changes shown below.

		SQLWorkBench V.1.0.5
			Added new data types
				Blob - For storing byte[] such as texture and image/sprite data
				ushort, uint
			Added new Index type
				List - this can be used to index columns of data type ushort and uint and will be the default index type for rowid's and autoincremented primary keys.
					It sohuld only be used for columns containging mainly sequential numbers as, although it is very fast, it also occupies a little more memory than Dict.
			Added support for very large tables
				The previous limit of the number of rows in a table was 64k. This has now been increased to 2b. When option is selected the table data and it's indexes will
				be partitioned into 8k chunks. It is advisable to use this option for all tables containing > 10k rows and it is required if the table is to contain > 64k rows.
			Added Stored SQL's
				SQL Statements can now be stored in the database. This will speed up execution time as the parsing stage of the sql command process is now done at design time
				rather than at run time.
			Added optional Database Password protection
				Please note: SQL4Unity does not store the actual password used so if you lose/forget the password you lose access to your data.
			Modified Database->Options->Import
				AutoCommit is now off by default to speed up the Import process
				Added an optional command for Import files
					SET COMMIT
					to set an immediate commit point
					or
					SET COMMIT n
					to commit automatically after n rows
					So SET COMMIT 5000 will commit after every 5000 rows of the import file

		SQLExecute
			Addded Parameter substitution in SQL commands
			Added the 'Execute' statement for running stored SQL's
			Added Database password option when opening a database in the form "DatabaseName#Password"
			Improved performance on indexes
			Fixed Deserialising error on MacOS

		SQL Table Editor
			Added Database password prompt for password protected databases

		SQL4Unity/Plugins/SQL4UnityServer.dll
			This new dll allows direct connection with a Microsoft SQL*Server database to enable syncronisation between a local SQL4Unity database and a remote server
